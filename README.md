#  UE4Cheat — DirectX11 DLL Cheat (ESP + Aimbot + ImGui) for Unreal Engine

**UE4Cheat** is an educational and personal project for games based on **Unreal Engine 4/5**, using a **DirectX11 hook**, **ImGui** for GUI, and **MinHook** to detour rendering functions.

> ❗ This project is **for educational purposes only** and intended solely for use in **single-player/offline games**.

##  Note on Surroundead Compatibility

This cheat was originally designed and tested against the **game _Surroundead_**, a single-player zombie survival game based on Unreal Engine.  
However, due to internal engine or anti-tamper changes, **this project currently does not work with Surroundead** in its current form.

Despite that, the project remains a valuable and reusable **template** for building your own UE4/UE5 cheat systems — especially for learning purposes or adapting to other games.
